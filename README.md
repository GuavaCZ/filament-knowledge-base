## Prerequisites
 - PHP 8.1+
 - Laravel 10+
 - Filament 3.2+

## Introduction

This package allows you to add many markdown powered knowledge bases to your filament application.

For this purpose, our package comes with two filament plugins, one for your knowledge base panels and one for your regular panels, which helps to glue them together.

You can turn any of your filament panels into a knowledge base by registering the `KnowledgeBasePlugin` in your panel's plugins config.

Currently, it is **required that you use a separate panel** for your knowledge base(s), as they will override your panel navigation.


### Knowledge base panel

A knowledge base panel is any panel that has the `KnowledgeBasePlugin` registered.

This is where you will find all your documentation files that you added to this knowledge base.

For detailed information about the knowledge base panel and how to customize it, check out its own [documentation here](URL_HERE).

### Knowledge Base Companion

The knowledge base companion is a plugin that should be registered in any of your **regular filament panels** that you want to deeply integrate with a knowledge base.

This will allow you to link your resources and pages with specific documentation pages, so your users can easily find the information they are looking for.

For example, the companion plugin renders a documentation button at the bottom of the sidebar which links to your knowledge base panel. 

It also allows you to render a help menu in the top navigation for each resource or page that should be linked with a specific documentation page. For example, you might want to show a help button in your `ProductResource` and link it to your `Product` documentation page.

For detailed information about the knowledge base companion plugin and how to customize it, check out its own [documentation here](URL_HERE).

Add the companion plugin to your regular panel(s):
```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Plugins\KnowledgeBaseCompanionPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->id('admin')
        ->path('admin')
        // ...
        ->plugins([
            KnowledgeBaseCompanionPlugin::make()
            ->knowledgeBasePanelId('knowledge-base'),
        ]);
}
```

### Modal Previews

Instead of redirecting the user to the documentation immediately, the package offers `modal previews`, which render the
markdown in a customizable modal with an optional button to open the full documentation page.

You can learn how to enable this feature in the `Customizations` section.

### Global Search

Knowledge base supports global search for all your markdown files and by default looks through the `title` and
the `content` of the markdown file. This way your users can quickly find what they are looking for.

## Storage

We currently support flat file (stored inside the source project) storage out of the box.

You can choose to store your documentation in:

- Markdown files (Preferred method)
- PHP classes (for complex cases)

In the future, we plan to also ship a Database Driver so you can store your documentation in the database.

## Usage

### Create a panel
You can turn any filament panel into a knowledge base by registering the `KnowledgeBasePlugin` in your panel's plugins config.

Currently, it is **required that you use a separate panel for your knowledge base(s)**, as they will override your panel navigation.

To create one, follow the [filament documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/configuration#creating-a-new-panel) on how to create one:
```shell
php artisan make:filament-panel knowledge-base
```

This will create a new panel provider in `app/Providers/Filament/KnowledgeBasePanelProvider.php`.

#### Make sure you have a custom filament theme

Check [here](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/themes#creating-a-custom-theme) how to create one.

You can create one specifically for the knowledge base panel, or you can reuse a custom theme from your other panel(s).

#### Build CSS

Now in your custom filament theme, make sure to include the plugin's php and blade files in the `tailwind.config.js`, so the CSS is correctly built:

```js
{
    content: [
        //...

        './vendor/guava/filament-knowledge-base/src/**/*.php',
        './vendor/guava/filament-knowledge-base/resources/**/*.blade.php',
    ]
}
```

### Register plugin

Finally, turn your panel into a knowledge base panel by registering the knowledge base plugin:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Plugins\KnowledgeBasePlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->id('knowledge-base')
        ->path('kb')
        // ...
        ->plugins([
            KnowledgeBasePlugin::make(),
        ]);
}
```

And that's it! Now you can access the knowledge base under `/kb` or whatever you configured in the `path` option of the panel.

### Create documentation

Right now your knowledge base panel should be quite empty.

To create your first documentation, run the `docs:make` command, such as:

```bash
php artisan docs:make
```

This will create a file in `/docs/en/prologue/getting-started.md`.

If you want to create the file for a specific locale, you can do so using the `--locale` option (can be repeated for
multiple locales):

```bash
php artisan docs:make prologue.getting-started --locale=de --locale=en
```

This would create the file for both the `de` and `en` locale.

If you **don't** pass any locale, it will automatically create the documentation file for every locale
in `/docs/{locale}`.

### Markdown

After you generate your documentation file, it's time to edit it.

A markdown file consists of two sections, the `Front Matter` and `Content`.

#### Front Matter

In the front matter, you can customize the documentation page, such as the title, the icon and so on:

```md
---
// Anything between these dashes is the front matter
title: My example documentation
icon: heroicon-o-book-open
---
```

#### Front Matter Options
Below is a list of currently available options in the front matter.



#### Group
Allows you to define the group (and it's title) of the documentation page.

```md
---
group: Getting Started
---
```

#### Parent
Allows you to define the parent of the documentation page.

```md
---
parent: my-parent
---
```

So for a file in `docs/en/prologue/getting-started/intro.md`, the parent would be `getting-started`.



And that's it! You've created a simple knowledge base inside Filament.

### Accessing the knowledge base

In every panel you registered the Knowlege Base plugin, we automatically inject a documentation button at the very
bottom of the sidebar.

![Documentation button example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_documentation_button.png)

But we offer a deeper integration to your panels.

#### Integrating into resources or pages

You will most likely have a section in your knowledge base dedicated to each of your resources (at least to the more
complex ones).

To integrate your resource with the documentation, all you need to do is implement the `HasKnowledgeBase` contract in
your resource or page.

This will require you to implement the `getDocumentation` method, where you simply return the documentation pages you
want to integrate. You can either return the `IDs` as strings (dot-separated path inside `/docs/{locale}/`) or use the
helper to retrieve the model:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Contracts\HasKnowledgeBase;
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Facades\KnowledgeBase;
class UserResource extends Resource implements HasKnowledgeBase
{
    // ...
    
    // 
    public static function getDocumentation(): array
    {
        return [
            'users.introduction',
            'users.authentication',
            KnowledgeBase::model()::find('users.permissions'),
        ];
    }
}
```

This will render a `Help menu` button at the end of the top navbar.

If you add more than one documentation file, it will render a dropdown menu, otherwise the `help` button will directly
reference the documentation you linked.

![Documentation button example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_help_menu.png)

#### Opening documentations in modals

From any livewire component where you use the documentation pages (you have rendered the Help Menu), you can create links that will automatically open the documentation
in a modal, by simply adding this fragment to the `href` attribute of the link:

```html
#modal-
<documentation-id>
```

such as

```html
<a href="#modal-users.introduction">Open Introduction</a>
```

### Modal Links

To make it easy to access the documentation from anywhere, this plugin adds intercepts fragment links anywhere in the filament panel in order to open up a modal for a
documentation page.

To use modal links, simply add a link in **any place** in your panel with a fragment in the format `#modal-<documentation-id>`, such as `#modal-intro.getting-started`,
for example:

```html
<a href="#modal-intro.getting-started">Open Introduction</a>
```

As long as a documentation with that ID exists (/docs/en/intro/getting-started.md), it will automatically open a modal with the content of that documentation.

You can even share the URL with someone and it will automatically open the modal upon opening!

![Modal links example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_modal_links.gif)

#### Disabling Modal Links

to disable modal links, simply call `disableModalLinks()` on the KnowledgeBasePlugin in your panel Service Provider..

### Help Actions

The plugin comes with a neat `HelpAction`, which can be linked to a specific markdown file or even a partial markdown
file.

For example, the `What is a slug?` help was added using the following:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Actions\Forms\Components\HelpAction;
->hintAction(HelpAction::forDocumentable('projects.creating-projects.slug')
    ->label('What is a slug?')
    ->slideOver(false)
),
```

### Accessing the documentation models

We use the `sushi` package in the background to store the documentations. This way, they behave almost like
regular `Eloquent models`.

#### Get model using our helper

To get the model, simply use our helper `KnowledgeBase::model()`:

```php
use \Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\KnowledgeBase;

// find specific model
KnowledgeBase::model()::find('<id>');
// query models
KnowledgeBase::model()::query()->where('title', 'Some title');
// etc.
```

## Cache

By default, the package caches all markdown files to ensure a smooth and fast user experience. If you don't see your
changes, make sure to clear the cache:

```bash
php artisan cache:clear
```

## Customization

A lot of the functionalities can be customized to a certain extent.

### Customize the knowledge base panel

You can customize the knowledge base panel to your liking using:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Filament\Panels\KnowledgeBasePanel;

KnowledgeBasePanel::configureUsing(
    fn(KnowledgeBasePanel $panel) => $panel
        // Your options here
);
```

#### Change brand name

For example to change the default brand name/title (displayed in the top left) of the panel, you can do:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Filament\Panels\KnowledgeBasePanel;

KnowledgeBasePanel::configureUsing(
    fn(KnowledgeBasePanel $panel) => $panel
        ->brandName('My Docs')
);
```

### Custom classes on documentation article

By default, the documentation article (the container where the markdown content is rendered) has a `gu-kb-article` class, which you can use to target and modify. You can
also add your own class(es) using:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Filament\Panels\KnowledgeBasePanel;

KnowledgeBasePanel::configureUsing(
    fn(KnowledgeBasePanel $panel) => $panel
        ->articleClass('max-w-2xl')
);
```

#### Disable default classes

To disable the default styling altogether, you can use:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Filament\Panels\KnowledgeBasePanel;

KnowledgeBasePanel::configureUsing(
    fn(KnowledgeBasePanel $panel) => $panel
        ->disableDefaultClasses()
);
```

### Disable the knowledge base panel button

When in a panel where the Knowledge Base plugin is enabled, we render by default in the bottom of the sidebar a button to go to the knowledge base panel. You can disable
it if you like:

```php
use \Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

$plugin->disableKnowledgeBasePanelButton();
```

### Disable the back to default panel button

When in the knowledge base panel, a similar button is rendered to go back to the default filament panel. You can disable it likewise:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Filament\Panels\KnowledgeBasePanel;

KnowledgeBasePanel::configureUsing(
    fn(KnowledgeBasePanel $panel) => $panel
        ->disableBackToDefaultPanelButton()
);
```

### Customize the help menu/button render hook

If you want to place the help menu / button someplace else, you can override the render hook:

```php
use \Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

$plugin->helpMenuRenderHook(PanelsRenderHook::TOPBAR_START);
```

### Enable modal previews

If you want to open documentations in modal previews instead of immediately redirecting to the full pages, you can
enable it like this:

```php
$plugin->modalPreviews();
```

![Modal Previews Example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_modal_previews.jpeg)

#### Slide overs

If you prefer to use slide overs, you can additionally also enable them:

```php
$plugin->slideOverPreviews();
```

![Modal Slideover Example](/docs/images/screenshot_modal_slideovers.jpeg)


#### Enable breadcrumbs in modal preview titles

When using modal previews, by default the title shows just that, the title of the documentation page.

If you'd rather show the full breadcrumb to the documentation page, you may enable it like so:

```php
$plugin->modalTitleBreadcrumbs();
```

![Modal Breadcrumbs Example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_modal_breadcrumbs.jpeg)

### Open documentation links in new tab

When you open a documentation, by default it will be opened in the same tab.

To change this, you can customize your plugin:

```php
$plugin->openDocumentationInNewTab()
```


## Markdown

We use CommonMark as the markdown parser and the league/commonmark php implementation. Check their respective websites
for a reference on how to use markdown.

- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
- [League CommonMark](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/)

We also added some custom parsers/extensions to the Markdown Parser, described below.

### Markers support

In order to mark some words with your primary theme color, you can use the following syntax:

```
In this example, ==this text== will be marked.
```

The result looks like this, depending on your primary color:

![Marker example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_marker.png)

### Tables support

You can use the regular markdown syntax to render tables styled to match filament tables.

```md
| Syntax     |             Description (center)              |     Foo (right) | Bar (left)      |
|------------|:---------------------------------------------:|----------------:|:----------------|
| Header     |                     Title                     |       Something | Else            |
| Paragraphs |  First paragraph. <br><br> Second paragraph.  | First paragraph | First paragraph |
```

![Tables example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_tables.png)

### Quotes support

Using the regular markdown syntax for quotes, you can render neat banners such as:

```md
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Make sure that the slug is unique!
```

![Quotes example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_quotes.png)

### Syntax Highlighting

We offer syntax highlighting through shiki (requires NodeJS on the server)

- [ShikiJS](https://shiki.style/)
- [Spatie ShikiPHP](https://github.com/spatie/shiki-php)

**Note:** Because of the additional installation steps, syntax highlighting is disabled by default.

To enable it, you MUST have both the npm package `shiki` and `spatie/shiki-php` installed.

Which versions of the shiki packages to choose depends on you. I **highly recommend going with the latest versions**,
but if you encounter some issues due to incompatibility with other packages, you might need to downgrade.

Check the table below for compatible versions.

| Shiki PHP Version | Shiki JS Version |
|-------------------|------------------|
| ^2.0              | ^1.0             |
| ^1.3              | ^0.14            |

#### Installing spatie/shiki-php:

```bash
composer require spatie/shiki-php:"^2.0"
```

#### Installing shiki:

```bash
npm install shiki@^1.0
```

#### When using a Node Version Manager:

If you use Herd or another NVM, you will most likely need to create a symlink to your node version. Please follow the
instructions [here](https://github.com/spatie/shiki-php?tab=readme-ov-file#using-node-version-manager).

Then you can enable syntax highlighting using:

```php
use Guava\FilamentKnowledgeBase\Filament\Panels\KnowledgeBasePanel;

KnowledgeBasePanel::configureUsing(
    fn(KnowledgeBasePanel $panel) => $panel
        ->syntaxHighlighting()
);
```

![Syntax highlighting example](https://github.com/GuavaCZ/filament-knowledge-base/raw/main/docs/images/screenshot_syntax_highlighting.png)

### Vite assets support

You can use the default image syntax to include vite assets, as long as you provide the full path from your root project
directory:

```md
![my image](/resources/img/my-image.png)
```

### Including other files

We support including markdown files within other files. This is especially useful if you want to organize your markdown
or display snippets of a whole documentation as a help button without duplicating your markdown files.

The syntax is as follows:

```md
@include(prologue.getting-started)
```

This is extremely helpful when you want to display help buttons for a concrete component or field, but don't want to
deal with duplicated information.

You can simply extract parts of your markdown into smaller markdown files and include them in your main file. That way
you can only display the partials in your `Help Actions`.
